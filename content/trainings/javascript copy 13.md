          # What is JavaScript


          JavaScript is a programming language, embedded in web pages and it is used in order to manipulate the HTML content and therefore make a web page interactive.


          <div class="div1">This is a div</div>


          More specifically, it is:


          * a scripting language

          * dynamically-typed


          ```javascript{3-4, 8}

          console.log('Hello world');

          console.log('Hello world');

          console.log('Hello world');

          console.log('Hello world');

          console.log('Hello world');

          console.log('Hello world');

          ```


          <row>This is a row</row>

          <row>This is another row</div>

          <row> This is a new row</row>


          <div class="myDiv"> This is myDiv </div>


          | Attribute   | Description                                                 |

          | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |

          | onchange    | Script to be run when the value of the element is changed   |
