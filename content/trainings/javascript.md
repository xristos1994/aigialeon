          JavaScript is a programming language, embedded in web pages and it is used in order to manipulate the HTML content and therefore make a web page interactive.


          <div class="xxx">Test Div with class xxx</div>

          # Why JavaScript


          It is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented programming language with first-class functions, most commonly known as a client-side scripting language for web pages.


          It has support for procedural, object-oriented and functional programming styles, which makes it very flexible for developers.


          JavaScript can also be used for creating:


          * web applications for browsers

          * browser extensions

          * desktop apps

          * native mobile apps and many more

          There are ten basic data types in JavaScript devided into two categories:

            Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, BigInt
