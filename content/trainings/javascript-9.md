          # What is JavaScript


          JavaScript is a programming language, embedded in web pages and it is used in order to manipulate the HTML content and therefore make a web page interactive.


          <div class="xxx">Test Div with class xxx</div>


          More specifically, it is:


          - a scripting language

          - dynamically-typed
      - pageTitle: Why Javascript

          # Why JavaScript


          It is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented programming language with first-class functions, most commonly known as a client-side scripting language for web pages.


          It has support for procedural, object-oriented and functional programming styles, which makes it very flexible for developers.


          JavaScript can also be used for creating:


          - web applications for browsers

          - browser extensions

          - desktop apps

          - native mobile apps and many more

          Data types are the classifications we give to the different kinds of data that we use in programming.</br>

          There are ten basic data types in JavaScript devided into two categories:


          - primitive data types</br>
            Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, BigInt

          - reference data types </br>
            Object, Array, Function

          Any number, including numbers with decimals.<br/>
